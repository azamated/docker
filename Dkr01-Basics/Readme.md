### DKR 01

- Install Docker on your system as stated in the official documentation. 

- Run a container on port 28080 from the official nginx image

- Display a list of running containers in the console with the command: docker ps

- Open the address http://127.0.0.1:28080 in your browser (or using the curl utility) - the nginx welcome page should appear.
 
- Delete the previously running container

- Run the docker ps command, thereby check the changes in the list of running containers - the list of containers should be empty.

- Open the address http://127.0.0.1:28080 in your browser (or using the curl utility) - there should be an error now, since we have already deleted the container
